The BME280 is a temperature, pressure,
humidity, and altitude sensor available in 
Qwiic interface packaging from Sparkfun
[P/N SEN-14348](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14348).

Follow the tutorials and documentation at
[Qwiic_BME280_Py](https://qwiic-bme280-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
for a general start.

[sen14348_exporter](https://github.com/ashtreefarms/sen14348-exporter)
is a Python Prometheus exporter for the SparkFun Environmental Combo Breakout (SEN-14348)
which is more complete than the code here, and also untested by me.
