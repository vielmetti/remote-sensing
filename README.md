# remote-sensing

A remote sensing stack with NATS.io and Tailscale

My [initial writeup](https://vielmetti.typepad.com/logbook/2020/05/logbook-natsio-and-tailscale.html)
is a good start - the goal of this repo is to share code fragments that come from
answering the question "how hot is it in the attic", and "should I open or close
the windows".
